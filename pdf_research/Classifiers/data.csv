10,MyriadPro-Light,"  In the era of big data, deep learning for predicting stock market prices and trends has  become even more popular than before. We collected 2 years of data from Chinese  stock market and proposed a comprehensive customization of feature engineering and deep learning-based model for predicting price trend of stock markets. The  proposed solution is comprehensive as it includes pre-processing of the stock market  dataset, utilization of multiple feature engineering techniques, combined with a customized deep learning based system for stock market price trend prediction. We conducted comprehensive evaluations on frequently used machine learning models and  conclude that our proposed solution outperforms due to the comprehensive feature  engineering that we built. The system achieves overall high accuracy for stock market  trend prediction. With the detailed design and evaluation of prediction term lengths,  feature engineering, and data pre-processing methods, this work contributes to the  stock analysis research community both in the financial and technical domains.

10,WarnockPro-Regular,"Stock market is one of the major fields that investors are dedicated to, thus stock market  price trend prediction is always a hot topic for researchers from both financial and technical domains. In this research, our objective is to build a state-of-art prediction model  for price trend prediction, which focuses on short-term price trend prediction. As concluded by Fama in [26], financial time series prediction is known to be a notoriously difficult task due to the generally accepted, semi-strong form of market efficiency  and  the  high  level  of  noise.  Back  in  2003,  Wang  et  al.  in  [44]  already  applied  artificial  neural networks on stock market price prediction and focused on volume, as a specific  feature of stock market. One of the key findings by them was that the volume was not  found  to  be  effective  in  improving  the  forecasting  performance  on  the  datasets  they  used,  which  was  S&P  500  and  DJI.  Ince  and  Trafalis  in  [15]  targeted  short-term  forecasting and applied support vector machine (SVM) model on the stock price prediction.  Their  main  contribution  is  performing  a  comparison  between  multi-layer  perceptron  (MLP) and SVM then found that most of the scenarios SVM outperformed MLP, while  ",True,1264,178.582702636,540.9347626285129,120.13550000000002,313.887909814,193.75240981399998,,,,,

10,WarnockPro-Regular,"the result was also affected by different trading strategies. In the meantime, researchers  from financial domains were applying conventional statistical methods and signal processing techniques on analyzing stock market data. The  optimization  techniques,  such  as  principal  component  analysis  (PCA)  were  also  applied in short-term stock price prediction [22]. During the years, researchers are not  only focused on stock price-related analysis but also tried to analyze stock market transactions  such  as  volume  burst  risks,  which  expands  the  stock  market  analysis  research  domain  broader  and  indicates  this  research  domain  still  has  high  potential  [39].  As  the  artificial  intelligence  techniques  evolved  in  recent  years,  many  proposed  solutions  attempted to combine machine learning and deep learning techniques based on previous  approaches, and then proposed new metrics that serve as training features such as Liu  and Wang [23]. This type of previous works belongs to the feature engineering domain  and can be considered as the inspiration of feature extension ideas in our research. Liu  et  al.  in  [24]  proposed  a  convolutional  neural  network  (CNN)  as  well  as  a  long  shortterm  memory  (LSTM)  neural  network  based  model  to  analyze  different  quantitative  strategies in stock markets. The CNN serves for the stock selection strategy, automatically extracts features based on quantitative data, then follows an LSTM to preserve the  time-series features for improving profits. The latest work also proposes a similar hybrid neural network architecture, integrating  a convolutional neural network with a bidirectional long short-term memory to predict  the stock market index [4]. While the researchers frequently proposed different neural  network solution architectures, it brought further discussions about the topic if the high  cost of training such models is worth the result or not. There are three key contributions of our work (1) a new dataset extracted and cleansed  (2) a comprehensive feature engineering, and (3) a customized long short-term memory  (LSTM) based deep learning model. We have built the dataset by ourselves from the data source as an open-sourced data  API called Tushare [43]. The novelty of our proposed solution is that we proposed a feature  engineering  along  with  a  fine-tuned  system  instead  of  just  an  LSTM  model  only.  We observe from the previous works and find the gaps and proposed a solution architecture with a comprehensive feature engineering procedure before training the prediction model. With the success of feature extension method collaborating with recursive  feature  elimination  algorithms,  it  opens  doors  for  many  other  machine  learning  algorithms to achieve high accuracy scores for short-term price trend prediction. It proved  the  effectiveness  of  our  proposed  feature  extension  as  feature  engineering. We  further  introduced our customized LSTM model and further improved the prediction scores in  all  the  evaluation  metrics.  The  proposed  solution  outperformed  the  machine  learning  and deep learning-based models in similar previous works.

10,WarnockPro-Regular,"In this section, we discuss related works. We reviewed the related work in two different  domains: technical and financial, respectively. Kim  and  Han  in  [19]  built  a  model  as  a  combination  of  artificial  neural  networks  (ANN) and genetic algorithms (GAs) with discretization of features for predicting stock  price index. The data used in their study include the technical indicators as well as the  direction  of  change  in  the  daily  Korea  stock  price  index  (KOSPI).  They  used  the  data  containing samples of 2928 trading days, ranging from January 1989 to December 1998,  and give their selected features and formulas. They also applied optimization of feature  discretization, as a technique that is similar to dimensionality reduction. The strengths of  their work are that they introduced GA to optimize the ANN. First, the amount of input  features and processing elements in the hidden layer are 12 and not adjustable. Another  limitation is in the learning process of ANN, and the authors only focused on two factors  in optimization. While they still believed that GA has great potential for feature discretization optimization. Our initialized feature pool refers to the selected features. Qiu and  Song in [34] also presented a solution to predict the direction of the Japanese stock market based on an optimized artificial neural network model. In this work, authors utilize  genetic algorithms together with artificial neural network based models, and name it as  a hybrid GA-ANN model. Piramuthu in [33] conducted a thorough evaluation of different feature selection methods for data mining applications. He used for datasets, which were credit approval data,  loan  defaults  data,  web  traffic  data,  tam,  and  kiang  data,  and  compared  how  different  feature  selection  methods  optimized  decision  tree  performance.  The  feature  selection  methods he compared included probabilistic distance measure: the Bhattacharyya measure, the Matusita measure, the divergence measure, the Mahalanobis distance measure,  and  the  Patrick-Fisher  measure.  For  inter-class  distance  measures:  the  Minkowski  distance measure, city block distance measure, Euclidean distance measure, the Chebychev  distance measure, and the nonlinear (Parzen and hyper-spherical kernel) distance measure. The strength of this paper is that the author evaluated both probabilistic distancebased and several inter-class feature selection methods. Besides, the author performed  the evaluation based on different datasets, which reinforced the strength of this paper.  However, the evaluation algorithm was a decision tree only. We cannot conclude if the  feature selection methods will still perform the same on a larger dataset or a more complex model. Hassan and Nath in [9] applied the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) on the stock market forecasting on stock prices of four different Airlines. They reduce states of the model  into four states: the opening price, closing price, the highest price, and the lowest price.  The strong point of this paper is that the approach does not need expert knowledge to  build a prediction model. While this work is limited within the industry of Airlines and  evaluated on a very small dataset, it may not lead to a prediction model with generality.  One of the approaches in stock market prediction related works could be exploited to  ",True,3401,117.63780212399999,479.9859421277142,67.40119999999999,629.05719082,561.6559908199999,,,,,

10,WarnockPro-Regular,"do the comparison work. The authors selected a maximum 2 years as the date range of  training and testing dataset, which provided us a date range reference for our evaluation  part. Lei  in  [21]  exploited  Wavelet  Neural  Network  (WNN)  to  predict  stock  price  trends.  The  author  also  applied  Rough  Set  (RS)  for  attribute  reduction  as  an  optimization.  Rough Set was utilized to reduce the stock price trend feature dimensions. It was also  used to determine the structure of the Wavelet Neural Network. The dataset of this work  consists of five well-known stock market indices, i.e., (1) SSE Composite Index (China),  (2)  CSI  300  Index  (China),  (3)  All  Ordinaries  Index  (Australian),  (4)  Nikkei  225  Index  (Japan), and (5) Dow Jones Index (USA). Evaluation of the model was based on different stock market indices, and the result was convincing with generality. By using Rough  Set for optimizing the feature dimension before processing reduces the computational  complexity. However, the author only stressed the parameter adjustment in the discussion part but did not specify the weakness of the model itself. Meanwhile, we also found  that the evaluations were performed on indices, the same model may not have the same  performance if applied on a specific stock. Lee in [20] used the support vector machine (SVM) along with a hybrid feature selection  method  to  carry  out  prediction  of  stock  trends.  The  dataset  in  this  research  is  a  sub dataset of NASDAQ Index in Taiwan Economic Journal Database (TEJD) in 2008.  The  feature  selection  part  was  using  a  hybrid  method,  supported  sequential  forward  search (SSFS) played the role of the wrapper. Another advantage of this work is that they  designed a detailed procedure of parameter adjustment with performance under different parameter values. The clear structure of the feature selection model is also heuristic  to  the  primary  stage  of  model  structuring.  One  of  the  limitations  was  that  the  performance of SVM was compared to back-propagation neural network (BPNN) only and did  not compare to the other machine learning algorithms. Sirignano  and  Cont  leveraged  a  deep  learning  solution  trained  on  a  universal  feature set of financial markets in [40]. The dataset used included buy and sell records of  all  transactions,  and  cancellations  of  orders  for  approximately  1000  NASDAQ  stocks  through  the  order  book  of  the  stock  exchange.  The  NN  consists  of  three  layers  with  LSTM units and a feed-forward layer with rectified linear units (ReLUs) at last, with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm as an optimization. Their universal model was  able to generalize and cover the stocks other than the ones in the training data. Though  they mentioned the advantages of a universal model, the training cost was still expensive.  Meanwhile,  due  to  the  inexplicit  programming  of  the  deep  learning  algorithm,  it  is unclear that if there are useless features contaminated when feeding the data into the  model. Authors found out that it would have been better if they performed feature selection part before training the model and found it as an effective way to reduce the computational complexity. Ni et al. in [30] predicted stock price trends by exploiting SVM and performed fractal  feature selection for optimization. The dataset they used is the Shanghai Stock Exchange  Composite  Index  (SSECI),  with  19  technical  indicators  as  features.  Before  processing  the  data,  they  optimized  the  input  data  by  performing  feature  selection.  When  finding  the  best  parameter  combination,  they  also  used  a  grid  search  method,  which  is  k  cross-validation.  Besides,  the  evaluation  of  different  feature  selection  methods  is  also  ",True,3845,117.63780212399999,479.98986212399996,67.256,699.657227441,632.4012274410001,,,,,

10,WarnockPro-Regular,"comprehensive. As the authors mentioned in their conclusion part, they only considered  the  technical  indicators  but  not  macro  and  micro  factors  in  the  financial  domain. The  source of datasets that the authors used was similar to our dataset, which makes their  evaluation results useful to our research. They also mentioned a method called k crossvalidation when testing hyper-parameter combinations. McNally  et  al.  in  [27]  leveraged  RNN  and  LSTM  on  predicting  the  price  of  Bitcoin,  optimized by using the Boruta algorithm for feature engineering part, and it works similarly  to  the  random  forest  classifier.  Besides  feature  selection,  they  also  used  Bayesian  optimization  to  select  LSTM  parameters. The  Bitcoin  dataset  ranged  from  the  19th  of  August 2013 to 19th of July 2016. Used multiple optimization methods to improve the  performance  of  deep  learning  methods. The  primary  problem  of  their  work  is  overfitting. The research problem of predicting Bitcoin price trend has some similarities with  stock market price prediction. Hidden features and noises embedded in the price data  are threats of this work. The authors treated the research question as a time sequence  problem. The best part of this paper is the feature engineering and optimization part; we  could replicate the methods they exploited in our data pre-processing. Weng  et  al.  in  [45]  focused  on  short-term  stock  price  prediction  by  using  ensemble  methods of four well-known machine learning models. The dataset for this research is  five sets of data. They obtained these datasets from three open-sourced APIs and an R  package  named  TTR.  The  machine  learning  models  they  used  are  (1)  neural  network  regression  ensemble  (NNRE),  (2)  a  Random  Forest  with  unpruned  regression  trees  as  base learners (RFR), (3) AdaBoost with unpruned regression trees as base learners (BRT)  and  (4)  a  support  vector  regression  ensemble  (SVRE).  A  thorough  study  of  ensemble  methods specified for short-term stock price prediction. With background knowledge,  the authors selected eight technical indicators in this study then performed a thoughtful  evaluation of five datasets. The primary contribution of this paper is that they developed  a platform for investors using R, which does not need users to input their own data but  call  API  to  fetch  the  data  from  online  source  straightforward.  From  the  research  perspective, they only evaluated the prediction of the price for 1 up to 10 days ahead but did  not evaluate longer terms than two trading weeks or a shorter term than 1 day. The primary limitation of their research was that they only analyzed 20 U.S.-based stocks, the  model might not be generalized to other stock market or need further revalidation to see  if it suffered from overfitting problems. Kara et al. in [17] also exploited ANN and SVM in predicting the movement of stock  price index. The data set they used covers a time period from January 2, 1997, to December  31,  2007,  of  the  Istanbul  Stock  Exchange.  The  primary  strength  of  this  work  is  its  detailed record of parameter adjustment procedures. While the weaknesses of this work  are  that  neither  the  technical  indicator  nor  the  model  structure  has  novelty,  and  the  authors did not explain how their model performed better than other models in previous  works. Thus, more validation works on other datasets would help. They explained how  ANN  and  SVM  work  with  stock  market  features,  also  recorded  the  parameter  adjustment. The implementation part of our research could benefit from this previous work. Jeon  et  al.  in  [16]  performed  research  on  millisecond  interval-based  big  dataset  by  using pattern graph tracking to complete stock price prediction tasks. The dataset they  used is a millisecond interval-based big dataset of historical stock data from KOSCOM,  ",True,3980,117.63780212399999,479.99574212025635,67.253603027,699.657227441,632.403624414,,,,,

10,WarnockPro-Regular,"from  August  2014  to  October  2014,  10G–15G  capacity.  The  author  applied  Euclidean  distance, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for pattern recognition. For feature selection,  they used stepwise regression. The authors completed the prediction task by ANN and  Hadoop and RHive for big data processing. The “Results” section is based on the result  processed  by  a  combination  of  SAX  and  Jaro–Winkler  distance.  Before  processing  the  data, they generated aggregated data at 5-min intervals from discrete data. The primary  strength  of  this  work  is  the  explicit  structure  of  the  whole  implementation  procedure.  While they exploited a relatively old model, another weakness is the overall time span of  the training dataset is extremely short. It is difficult to access the millisecond intervalbased data in real life, so the model is not as practical as a daily based data model. Huang  et  al.  in  [12]  applied  a  fuzzy-GA  model  to  complete  the  stock  selection  task.  They used the key stocks of the 200 largest market capitalization listed as the investment  universe in the Taiwan Stock Exchange. Besides, the yearly financial statement data and  the stock returns were taken from the Taiwan Economic Journal (TEJ) database at www. tej.com.tw/ for the time period from year 1995 to year 2009. They conducted the fuzzy  membership function with model parameters optimized with GA and extracted features  for  optimizing  stock  scoring.  The  authors  proposed  an  optimized  model  for  selection  and scoring of stocks. Different from the prediction model, the authors more focused on  stock  rankings,  selection,  and  performance  evaluation.  Their  structure  is  more  practical among investors. But in the model validation part, they did not compare the model  with existed algorithms but the statistics of the benchmark, which made it challenging to  identify if GA would outperform other algorithms. Fischer and Krauss in [5] applied long short-term memory (LSTM) on financial market prediction. The dataset they used is S&P 500 index constituents from Thomson Reuters. They  obtained  all  month-end  constituent  lists  for  the  S&P  500  from  Dec  1989  to  Sep 2015, then consolidated the lists into a binary matrix to eliminate survivor bias. The  authors also used RMSprop as an optimizer, which is a mini-batch version of rprop. The  primary strength of this work is that the authors used the latest deep learning technique  to perform predictions. They relied on the LSTM technique, lack of background knowledge in the financial domain. Although the LSTM outperformed the standard DNN and  logistic  regression  algorithms,  while  the  author  did  not  mention  the  effort  to  train  an  LSTM with long-time dependencies. Tsai and Hsiao in [42] proposed a solution as a combination of different feature selection methods for prediction of stocks. They used Taiwan Economic Journal (TEJ) database as data source. The data used in their analysis was from year 2000 to 2007. In their  work, they used a sliding window method and combined it with multi layer perceptron  (MLP) based artificial neural networks with back propagation, as their prediction model.  In their work, they also applied principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality  reduction,  genetic  algorithms  (GA)  and  the  classification  and  regression  trees  (CART)  to  select  important  features.  They  did  not  just  rely  on  technical  indices  only.  Instead,  they also included both fundamental and macroeconomic indices in their analysis. The  authors  also  reported  a  comparison  on  feature  selection  methods.  The  validation  part  was done by combining the model performance stats with statistical analysis. Pimenta et al. in [32] leveraged an automated investing method by using multi-objective genetic programming and applied it in the stock market. The dataset was obtained  ",True,3938,117.637702941,479.9868229409999,67.257198449,699.657227441,632.400028992,,,,,

10,WarnockPro-Regular,"from  Brazilian  stock  exchange  market  (BOVESPA),  and  the  primary  techniques  they  exploited  were  a  combination  of  multi-objective  optimization,  genetic  programming,  and  technical  trading  rules.  For  optimization,  they  leveraged  genetic  programming  (GP)  to  optimize  decision  rules.  The  novelty  of  this  paper  was  in  the  evaluation  part.  They included a historical period, which was a critical moment of Brazilian politics and  economics  when  performing  validation.  This  approach  reinforced  the  generalization  strength  of  their  proposed  model.  When  selecting  the  sub-dataset  for  evaluation,  they  also set criteria to ensure more asset liquidity. While the baseline of the comparison was  too basic and fundamental, and the authors did not perform any comparison with other  existing models. Huang  and  Tsai  in  [13]  conducted  a  filter-based  feature  selection  assembled  with  a  hybrid  self-organizing  feature  map  (SOFM)  support  vector  regression  (SVR)  model  to  forecast Taiwan index futures (FITX) trend. They divided the training samples into clusters to marginally improve the training efficiency. The authors proposed a comprehensive model, which was a combination of two novel machine learning techniques in stock  market analysis. Besides, the optimizer of feature selection was also applied before the  data processing to improve the prediction accuracy and reduce the computational complexity of processing daily stock index data. Though they optimized the feature selection  part and split the sample data into small clusters, it was already strenuous to train daily  stock  index  data  of  this  model.  It  would  be  difficult  for  this  model  to  predict  trading  activities in shorter time intervals since the data volume would be increased drastically.  Moreover,  the  evaluation  is  not  strong  enough  since  they  set  a  single  SVR  model  as  a  baseline, but did not compare the performance with other previous works, which caused  difficulty for future researchers to identify the advantages of SOFM-SVR model why it  outperforms other algorithms. Thakur  and  Kumar  in  [41]  also  developed  a  hybrid  financial  trading  support  system by exploiting multi-category classifiers and random forest (RAF). They conducted  their  research  on  stock  indices  from  NASDAQ,  DOW  JONES,  S&P  500,  NIFTY  50,  and  NIFTY  BANK.  The  authors  proposed  a  hybrid  model  combined  random  forest  (RF)  algorithms  with  a  weighted  multicategory  generalized  eigenvalue  support  vector  machine  (WMGEPSVM)  to  generate  “Buy/Hold/Sell”  signals.  Before  processing  the  data, they used Random Forest (RF) for feature pruning. The authors proposed a practical model designed for real-life investment activities, which could generate three basic  signals for investors to refer to. They also performed a thorough comparison of related  algorithms. While they did not mention the time and computational complexity of their  works. Meanwhile, the unignorable issue of their work was the lack of financial domain  knowledge background. The investors regard the indices data as one of the attributes but  could not take the signal from indices to operate a specific stock straightforward. Hsu in [11] assembled feature selection with a back propagation neural network (BNN)  combined  with  genetic  programming  to  predict  the  stock/futures  price.  The  dataset  in  this  research  was  obtained  from  Taiwan  Stock  Exchange  Corporation  (TWSE). The  authors have introduced the description of the background knowledge in detail. While  the weakness of their work is that it is a lack of data set description. This is a combination  of  the  model  proposed  by  other  previous  works. Though  we  did  not  see  the  novelty  of  this  work,  we  can  still  conclude  that  the  genetic  programming  (GP)  algorithm  ",True,3943,117.63780212399999,479.99868212399997,67.257198449,699.657227441,632.400028992,,,,,

10,WarnockPro-Regular,"is  admitted  in  stock  market  research  domain.  To  reinforce  the  validation  strengths,  it  would be good to consider adding GP models into evaluation if the model is predicting a  specific price. Hafezi et al. in [7] built a bat-neural network multi-agent system (BN-NMAS) to predict  stock  price. The  dataset  was  obtained  from  the  Deutsche  bundes-bank. They  also  applied the Bat algorithm (BA) for optimizing neural network weights. The authors illustrated their overall structure and logic of system design in clear flowcharts. While there  were very few previous works that had performed on DAX data, it would be difficult to  recognize if the model they proposed still has the generality if migrated on other datasets. The system design and feature selection logic are fascinating, which worth referring  to.  Their  findings  in  optimization  algorithms  are  also  valuable  for  the  research  in  the  stock market price prediction research domain. It is worth trying the Bat algorithm (BA)  when constructing neural network models. Long et al. in [25] conducted a deep learning approach to predict the stock price movement.  The  dataset  they  used  is  the  Chinese  stock  market  index  CSI  300.  For  predicting the stock price movement, they constructed a multi-filter neural network (MFNN)  with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and back propagation optimizer for learning NN  parameters. The strength of this paper is that the authors exploited a novel model with a  hybrid model constructed by different kinds of neural networks, it provides an inspiration for constructing hybrid neural network structures. Atsalakis and Valavanis in [1] proposed a solution of a neuro-fuzzy system, which is  composed of controller named as Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), to  achieve short-term stock price trend prediction. The noticeable strength of this work is  the evaluation part. Not only did they compare their proposed system with the popular  data models, but also compared with investment strategies. While the weakness that we  found from their proposed solution is that their solution architecture is lack of optimization part, which might limit their model performance. Since our proposed solution is  also focusing on short-term stock price trend prediction, this work is heuristic for our  system design. Meanwhile, by comparing with the popular trading strategies from investors, their work inspired us to compare the strategies used by investors with techniques  used by researchers. Nekoeiqachkanloo et al. in [29] proposed a system with two different approaches for  stock investment. The strengths of their proposed solution are obvious. First, it is a comprehensive system that consists of data pre-processing and two different algorithms to  suggest  the  best  investment  portions.  Second,  the  system  also  embedded  with  a  forecasting component, which also retains the features of the time series. Last but not least,  their input features are a mix of fundamental features and technical indices that aim to  fill in the gap between the financial domain and technical domain. However, their work  has a weakness in the evaluation part. Instead of evaluating the proposed system on a  large dataset, they chose 25 well-known stocks. There is a high possibility that the wellknown stocks might potentially share some common hidden features. As another related latest work, Idrees et al. [14] published a time series-based prediction approach for the volatility of the stock market. ARIMA is not a new approach in the  time series prediction research domain. Their work is more focusing on the feature engineering side. Before feeding the features into ARIMA models, they designed three steps  ",True,3764,117.63780212399999,479.9800621202565,67.257198449,699.657227441,632.400028992,,,,,

10,WarnockPro-Regular,"for feature engineering: Analyze the time series, identify if the time series is stationary or  not, perform estimation by plot ACF and PACF charts and look for parameters. The only  weakness of their proposed solution is that the authors did not perform any customization  on  the  existing  ARIMA  model,  which  might  limit  the  system  performance  to  be  improved. One of the main weaknesses found in the related works is limited data-preprocessing  mechanisms built and used. Technical works mostly tend to focus on building prediction  models. When they select the features, they list all the features mentioned in previous  works and go through the feature selection algorithm then select the best-voted features.  Related works in the investment domain have shown more interest in behavior analysis,  such as how herding behaviors affect the stock performance, or how the percentage of  inside directors hold the firm’s common stock affects the performance of a certain stock.  These  behaviors  often  need  a  pre-processing  procedure  of  standard  technical  indices  and investment experience to recognize. In the related works, often a thorough statistical analysis is performed based on a special dataset and conclude new features rather than performing feature selections. Some  data, such as the percentage of a certain index fluctuation has been proven to be effective on stock performance. We believe that by extracting new features from data, then  combining such features with existed common technical indices will significantly benefit  the existing and well-tested prediction models.

First is the feature selection part, to guarantee the selected features are highly effective.  Second, we look into the data and perform the dimensionality reduction. And the last  part, which is the main contribution of our work is to build a prediction model of target  stocks. Figure 2 depicts a high-level architecture of the proposed solution. There  are  ways  to  classify  different  categories  of  stocks.  Some  investors  prefer  longterm investments, while others show more interest in short-term investments. It is common to see the stock-related reports showing an average performance, while the stock  price is increasing drastically; this is one of the phenomena that indicate the stock price  prediction has no fixed rules, thus finding effective features before training a model on  data is necessary. In this research, we focus on the short-term price trend prediction. Currently, we only  have the raw data with no labels. So, the very first step is to label the data.

10,WarnockPro-Regular,"From  the  result  of  the  previous  subsection,  we  can  see  that  when  predicting  the  price  trend  for  every  other  day  or  biweekly,  the  best  result  is  achieved  by  selecting  a  large  number of features. Within the selected features, some features processed from extension  methods  have  better  ranks  than  original  features,  which  proves  that  the  feature  extension method is useful for optimizing the model. The feature extension affects both  precision  and  efficiency,  while  in  this  part,  we  only  discuss  the  precision  aspect  and  leave efficiency part in the next step since PCA is the most effective method for training  efficiency optimization in our design. We involved an evaluation of how feature extension affects RFE and use the test result to measure the improvement of involving feature  extension. We further test the effectiveness of feature extension, i.e., if polarize, max–min scale,  and  calculate  fluctuation  percentage  works  better  than  original  technical  indices.  The  best  case  to  leverage  this  test  is  the  weekly  prediction  since  it  has  the  least  effective  feature selected. From the result we got from the last section, we know the best crossvalidation  score  appears  when  selecting  8  features.  The  test  consists  of  two  steps,  and  the first step is to test the feature set formed by original features only, in this case, only  SLOWK, SLOWD, and RSI_5 are included. The next step is to test the feature set of all  8 features we selected in the previous subsection. We leveraged the test by defining the  simplest DNN model with three layers.

From Fig. 7 we can conclude that PCA does not have a severe negative impact on prediction  precision.  The  true  positive  rate  and  false  positive  rate  are  barely  be  affected,  while the false negative and true negative rates are influenced by 2% to 4%. Besides evaluating how the number of selected features affects the training efficiency and model performance, we also leveraged a test upon how data pre-processing procedures affect the  training procedure and predicting result. Normalizing and max–min scaling is the most  commonly seen data pre-procedure performed before PCA, since the measure units of  features are varied, and it is said that it could increase the training efficiency afterward. We  leveraged  another  test  on  adding  pre-procedures  before  extracting  20  principal  components from the original dataset and make the comparison in the aspects of time  elapse of training stage and prediction precision. However, the test results lead to different conclusions. In Table 6 we can conclude that feature pre-processing does not have  a  significant  impact  on  training  efficiency,  but  it  does  influence  the  model  prediction  accuracy. Moreover, the first confusion matrix in Fig. 8 indicates that without any feature pre-processing procedure, the false-negative rate and true negative rate are severely  affected,  while  the  true  positive  rate  and  false  positive  rate  are  not  affected.  If  it  performs the normalization before PCA, both true positive rate and true negative rate are  decreasing by approximately 10%.

We  collected,  cleaned-up,  and  structured 2 years of Chinese stock market data. We reviewed different techniques often  used by real-world investors, developed a new algorithm component, and named it as  feature extension, which is proved to be effective. We applied the feature expansion (FE)  approaches with recursive feature elimination (RFE), followed by principal component  analysis (PCA), to build a feature engineering procedure that is both effective and efficient. The system is customized by assembling the feature engineering procedure with  an  LSTM  prediction  model,  achieved  high  prediction  accuracy  that  outperforms  the  leading models in most related works. We also carried out a comprehensive evaluation  of this work. By comparing the most frequently used machine learning models with our  proposed LSTM model under the feature engineering part of our proposed system, we  conclude many heuristic findings that could be future research questions in both technical and financial research domains. Our proposed solution is a unique customization as compared to the previous works  because  rather  than  just  proposing  yet  another  state-of-the-art  LSTM  model,  we  proposed  a  fine-tuned  and  customized  deep  learning  prediction  system  along  with  utilization  of  comprehensive  feature  engineering  and  combined  it  with  LSTM  to  perform  prediction.

10,KFNGAX+CMR10,"These lectures review the formalism of renormalization in quantum ﬁeld theories with special regard to eﬀective quantum ﬁeld theories. It is well known that quantum ﬁeld theories are plagued by ultraviolet (UV) divergences at very short distance scales and infrared (IR) divergences at long distances. Renormalization theory provides a systematic way in which to deal with the UV divergences. Eﬀective ﬁeld theories deal with the separation of physics on diﬀerent length or energy scales. The short-distance physics is described by means of Wilson coeﬃcient functions, whereas the long-distance physics is contained in the matrix elements of eﬀective operators built out of the quantum ﬁelds for the low-energy eﬀective degrees of freedom of the theory. Renormalization theory is as important for eﬀective ﬁeld theories as for conventional quantum ﬁeld theories. Moreover, building on the Wilsonian approach to renormalization, eﬀective ﬁeld theories provide a framework for a deeper understanding of the physical meaning of renormalization. While the subject of renormalization theory is treated in every textbook on quantum ﬁeld theory (see e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]), more advanced topics such as the renormalization of composite operators, the mixing of such operators under scale evolution and the resummation of large logarithms of scale ratios are not always treated in as much detail as they deserve. Because of the central importance of this subject to the construction of eﬀective ﬁeld theories, this course summarizes the main concepts and applications in a concise manner. This course thus sets the basis for many of the more specialized lecture courses delivered at this school.

The primary focus in this course lies on the treatment of UV divergences in conventional quantum ﬁeld theories. Only the last lecture discusses renormalization in the context of eﬀective ﬁeld theories. We do not explore the structure of IR divergences in this course, since they are of a diﬀerent origin. Let me just mention for completeness that eﬀective theories have provided powerful new insights into the structure of IR divergences as well, see e.g. [8, 9, 10, 11].

7,ZHPALM+CMR7,"The Lagrangian (1.11) is the starting point for calculations in “renormalized perturbation theory”, which gives rise to ﬁnite scattering amplitudes. The counterterms start (e2) in perturbation theory and have a perturbative expansion in powers of the at renormalized coupling α = e2/(4π). Care must be taken to combine Feynman diagram with elementary vertices and counterterms at the same order in perturbation theory. When this is done consistently, the counterterms remove the UV divergences of Feynman graphs order by order in perturbation theory in α. The proof of this statement is known as the Bogoliubov-Parasiuk-Hepp-Zimmermann (BPHZ) theorem [15,16,17]. It states that all divergences of quantum ﬁeld theories can be removed by constructing counterterms for the superﬁcially divergent 1PI Feynman graphs. For practical purposes, it is useful to note that renormalization works not only for entire n-point functions, but also for individual Feynman diagrams.

In fact, the only known regularization scheme which preserves all of them is dimensional regularization [13,14].1 We have seen in the previous section that the UV divergences of QED n-point functions are at most of logarithmic strength. If we restrict the integrals over the loop momenta to less than 4 spacetime dimensions, then these logarithmically divergent integrals become ﬁnite.

10,EYSKRI+CMTI10,"You might be confused by the following subtlety related to the deﬁnition of the renormalized parameters in the on-shell scheme. Clearly, the bare parameters m0 and e0 in the QED Lagrangian are independent of the auxiliary scale µ, which we have introduced in (1.10). At ﬁrst sight, it appears that the renormalized mass and coupling deﬁned in (1.27) and (1.38) must be scale-dependent quantities. But I just told you that these parameters have been measured with high precision and thus they are deﬁnitely independent of µ. The resolution of this puzzle rests on the fact that the relations between the bare and renormalized quantities are deﬁned in the regularized 2(cid:15) spacetime dimensions. While in any renormalizable quantum theory in d = 4 ﬁeld theory it is possible to take the limit (cid:15) 0 at the end of a calculation of some observable, this limit must not be taken in relations such as (1.27) and (1.38), since the bare parameters m0 and e0 would diverge in this limit.

For example, if s for a high-energy process, then ln(s/m2) is a large logarithm. Typically, these logarithms appear as [α ln(s/m2)]n in higher orders, and they can threaten the convergence of the perturbative expansion if α ln(s/m2) = √s ﬁxes this problem, giving a Choosing the renormalization scale such that µ well behaved perturbative expansion in terms of the parameters α(µ) and m(µ) √s.

When µ crosses a quark threshold, the value of β0 changes abruptly, and the values of αs(µ) just above and below the threshold 91.188 GeV QCD contains must be matched to each other.

Class-II operators can always be removed using ﬁeld redeﬁnitions, which corresponds to a change of variables in the functional integral [53,54].2 An explicit proof of this statement is presented in Aneesh Manohar’s lectures [41] elsewhere in this book. Special care must be taken when these ﬁeld redeﬁnitions change the measure of the functional integral. This happens for the case of a fermionic chiral transformation and gives rise to the famous chiral anomaly [55]. In any event, the lesson is that at ﬁxed n 1 class-II operators can simply be removed from the operator basis.
